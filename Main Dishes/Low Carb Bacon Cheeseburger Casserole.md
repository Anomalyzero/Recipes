5. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs,  1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup shredded white cheddar cheese, heavy cream, and mustard.

7. Drizzle the liquid mixture on top.
8. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheddar and 1/2 cup shredded white cheddar cheese on top.
9. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the cheese begins to bubble. Mine was ready around 17.

# [Creamy White Wine Dijon Chicken](https://www.thecookierookie.com/creamy-white-wine-dijon-chicken/) 
##### Prep/Cook Time: 10 min/20 min

#### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 3 tablespoons butter unsalted
* 4 cloves garlic minced
* 6 sprigs fresh rosemary (needles removed from 2 of the sprigs)
* 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1 cup white wine wine that is enjoyable to drink
* 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
* 2 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce
* 1 cup heavy whipping cream
* ¼ cup plain Greek yogurt

#### Insturctions
1.) If using large chicken breasts, butterfly (cut in-half lengthwise) then pound (with a meat pounder) until even in thickness. If using small-ish breasts, just pound to an even thickness.

2.) Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the rosemary needles, rosemary sprigs and sauté for 15-30 seconds (just until crisp but not brown). Transfer rosemary to a paper towel and turn the heat to medium-high.

3.) Season chicken with salt & pepper and place in the pan. Cook 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate. Reduce heat to low.

4.) Deglaze the pan drippings by adding the wine to the pan while scraping it with a spatula. Turn heat to medium-low, add garlic and sauté the garlic for 30 seconds. Add in the mustard, cream and yogurt and stir until smooth. Cook the sauce 5 minutes, and add the chicken breasts. Cook an additional 10-15 minutes until sauce is thickened and chicken is no longer pink in the middle. A meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breasts should read 160°F (165° max).

5.) Garnish the chicken with the fried rosemary sprigs.

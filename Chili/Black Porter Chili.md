### Instructions 

#### 1. Cook The Beef 
In a large Dutch oven, or heavy-bottomed pot, over medium-high heat, heat olive oil.  
Once hot, add the ground beef and cook until browned, approximately 4 minutes.  
Add onion powder to cooking meat for flavor. Make sure you break up the beef as it cooks so it doesn’t form large chunks.

#### 2. Add Everything Else 
Add the beans, tomatoes, tomato paste, beer and spices. 
Simmer over medium heat for approximately 25 to 30 minutes, until thickened. 

#### 3. Top It Off 
Serve with any desired toppings such as shredded cheese or sour cream.

# [Balsamic Vinaigrette](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/best-balsamic-vinaigrette/) 
##### Prep Time: 5 min 

#### Ingredients 
* 2 tbsp honey
* 1 tbsp dijon mustard
* 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly crushed black pepper finely ground
* 1 large garlic clove minced or 1/2 tsp mincep garlic
* 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
* 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 

#### Instructions
* In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the honey, balsamic, mustard, salt, pepper and garlic.  
* Add the oil and whisk thoroughly to combine. Continue whisking until the dressing is fully emulsified.
* Store in a jar with a lid and refrigerate. Shake well before serving. Enjoy!

##### Notes
* If you choose to make this in the blender (as I like to do for almost every other recipe) this will be a thicker dressing. Still delicious, simply thicker. 
* Double the recipe to make extra to for salad later in the week.

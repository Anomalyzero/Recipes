# A digital cookbook without the unnecessary life backstory. 

This project contains recipes that have been converted from their original websites/pages into easy to read/follow markdown documents. 

Sources for the original inspiration for these recipes will be linked in the recipe. Some modifications have been made for better use in my kitchen with the ingredients I normally have.

Many of these recipes are "low carb" or "Keto" and will be labelled as such. Check with your doctor and/or nutritionist to see if a low carb/high fat diet is best for your nutrtional needs.

Enjoy!

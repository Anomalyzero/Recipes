### Instructions 

#### 1. Cook the Lentils 
In a large sauce pan, add the lentils and fill with water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil. 
Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until the lentils open and are tender. 
Drain the water from the lentils and return the lentils to the pot.

#### 2. Add Almost Everything 
Stir the lentils around in the pot mashing some of them against the pot to break open. 
Add the crushed tomato, ginger, garlic, cayenne pepper, water, butter, salt and pepper.

#### 3. Cook 
Cook for 1 hour until the dal is thick. Make sure to check the pot periodically to make sure the water does not cook out. 
In Denver, cover to reduce water loss. Add water in if needed.

#### 4. Finish with Cream and Cilantro 
Stir in cream, garnish with minced cilantro.

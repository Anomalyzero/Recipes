# [Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes](https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/cauliflower-mashed-potatoes/) 

###### Prep/Cook Time: 35 min

#### Ingredients:
* 1 large head cauliflower 
* 1 cup grated cheddar cheese (about 2.5 ounces by weight)
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 4 tbsp butter softened
* 1 tsp salt or to taste
* 1/4 tsp black pepper or to taste
* (4 tbsp chopped chives optional)


#### Instructions:
1. Cut the cauliflower heads down into florets, then steam or boil for about 8-10 minutes, until completely fork tender and soft.

2. Let the cauliflower drain and cool, then squeeze in a kitchen towel to remove the majority of the water in the cauliflower.
3. For a chunkier cauliflower mash, mix the cauliflower with the remaining ingredients by hand.
  For a smoother texture, puree the squeezed cauliflower in a food processor with everything but the chives, for about one minute, until smooth.
4. Mix in the chives if desired, or simply sprinkle on top to garnish. Enjoy!
